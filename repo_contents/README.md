# Coding Challenge

Find the total area covered by two **rectilinear** rectangles in a **2D** plane.

If the inputs are `A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H`, the two rectangles are defined in the following way:

- The coordinates of the bottom left corner of the first rectangle are `(A, B)` 
- The coordinates of the top right corner of the first rectangle are `(C, D)` 
- The coordinates of the bottom left corner of the second rectangle are `(E, F)` 
- The coordinates of the top right corner of the first rectangle are `(G, H)` 

**Example:**

```
Input: A = -3, B = 0, C = 3, D = 4, E = 0, F = -1, G = 9, H = 2
Output: 45
